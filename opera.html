        All:                          If they can!

                    These are the phenomena
                    That ev'ry pretty domina
                    Is hoping at her Universitee we shall see.

                    These are the phenomena
                    That ev'ry pretty domina
                    Is hoping at her Universitee we shall see!

    Hilarion:    So that's the Princess Ida's castle!  Well,
                They must be lovely girls, indeed, if it requires
                Such walls as those to keep intruders off!

    Cyril:       To keep men off is only half their charge,
                And that the easier half. I much suspect
                The object of these walls is not so much
                To keep men off as keep the maidens in!

    Florian:     But what are these?  (Examining some Collegiate robes)

    Hilarion:    (looking at them)  Why, Academic robes,
                Worn by the lady undergraduates
                When they matriculate.  Let's try them on.  (They do
                        so.)
                Why, see — we're covered to the very toes.
                Three lovely lady undergraduates
                Who, weary of the world and all its wooing — (pose)

    Florian:     And penitent for deeds there's no undoing — (pose)

    Cyril:       Looked at askance by well-conducted maids — (pose)

    All:         Seek sanctuary in these classic shades!

                            TRIO (Cyril, Hilarion and Florian)
                                    "I am a maiden"
