    <h4 class="Hilarion">Hilarion:</h4> 
        <p class="speech">So that's the Princess Ida's castle!  Well,
                They must be lovely girls, indeed, if it requires
                Such walls as those to keep intruders off!
        </p>   

    <h4 class="Cyril">Cyril:</h4>  
        <p class="speech">To keep men off is only half their charge,
                And that the easier half. I much suspect
                The object of these walls is not so much
                To keep men off as keep the maidens in!

    <h4 class="Hilarion">Hilarion:</h4>   
        <p class="speech">(looking at them)  Why, Academic robes,
                Worn by the lady undergraduates
                When they matriculate.  Let's try them on.  <p class="direction">(They do
                        so.)</p>
                Why, see — we're covered to the very toes.
                Three lovely lady undergraduates
                Who, weary of the world and all its wooing — <p class="direction">(pose)</p>
